# BBC-Micro-Character-Test
A short program to display the computer's character set including all screen modes.

Overall, the code displays the character codes and corresponding characters for each screen mode (0 to 7), allowing the user to view them and pressing any key to proceed to the next screen mode. Once all screen modes have been displayed, a final message is printed, and the program ends.

Please note that Acorn BBC BASIC is specific to Acorn computers and may have slight differences compared to other BASIC dialects.
